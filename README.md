# Node API Starter

This is a simple node api starter template

## Prerequisites

### Things you will need:
- Git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Node/NPM (https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Things you will want:
- Nodemon (https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
- Postman (https://www.getpostman.com/)

## Getting Started

1) Clone the repository into a directory on your machine
	
		git clone enter_git_repo_url_here
		
2) Navigate to the directory with command line and run the following to download all necessary node modules:

		npm install

3)	Start the api locally by running the following:

		nodemon app.js

Your locally served api will be running on port http://localhost:1337

## Notes

Using "nodemon app.js" rather than just "node app.js" will restart the locally served api with each saved change that is made to the project.
